        <h1>IT'S RAGNARÖK</h1>
        <p>
          Ragnarök, is a major event first prophesied by the Jötunn Gróa that
          foresees the <br />ultimate battle that results in the death of many
          gods, including Odin and Thor, as well as the "rebirth" of the world
          through submersion into water. <br />Kratos and Atreus are also
          mentioned in the prophecy, as being the center of everything. However,
          in truth, it will only result in <br />the destruction of Asgard while
          the other realms will stay intact. Furthermore, it will also result in
          the deaths of only Thor and Odin.

              <p>
                Ragnarök was first prophesied by the Jötunn Seeress Gróa, who
                unintentionally saw a vision of the actual events while
                searching in her library for ancient tomes for knowledge that
                would help her find her lost husband Aurvandil.

            <div class="feature-text">
              <p>
                In her vision she saw the beginning of Fimbulwinter, Sköll and
                Hati devouring the Sun and Moon, Surtr emerging from Muspelheim,
                Hróðvitnir breaking free from his chain and the Gods once again
                at each other's throats.

            <div class="feature-text">
              <p>
                However, her vision was so powerful that it was felt by Odin
                himself, who promptly journeyed to Gróa's library to demand what
                she had seen. Seeing that the seeress was hesitant to tell him
                anything, Odin proceeded to strangle her, but not before coldly
                revealing that Thor had killed her husband long ago.

            <p>
              The ancestral homeland of the Dwarves, one of the most wiley,
              inventive and cunning races in the Nine Realms; Svartalfheim's
              exact layout is unknown as it is off-limits to anyone except
              dwarves including the Aesir; a rare reward from Odin as payment
              for services rendered by the Dwarves for his tribe in ages past.

            <hr />
            <p>
              By far the most mysterious, bizarre and unearthly of the Nine
              Realms, Vanaheim is an endless expanse of bright and
              darkly-colourful forests and shining lakes where wild magic runs
              amok and the very air is filled with disembodied voices. It is the
              homeland of the Vanir tribe of gods, the greatest rivals of the
              Aesir tribe of gods and treacherous for any besides them.

            <hr />
            <p>
              A small but deceptively dangerous realm covered in magical mists
              and at one time home to a breakaway colony of dwarves led by their
              great craftsman Ivaldi. A maze that constantly rearranges itself
              every time someone enters is the Dwarfs greatest testament to
              their craft.

            <p>
              Perhaps most appropriate for the ancestral realm of the giants,
              Jötunheim features the tallest mountains in all the nine realms,
              which gives you an apt view to the numerous giant corpses that
              litter the realm for all to see. No one lives here anymore, the
              only thing left of arguably the wisest among the races of the nine
              realms is an endless landscape of smaller mountain ranges.

              A land of primordial fire and blistering heat home to a tribe of
              slumbering fire giants, Muspelheim is an unending landscape of
              lava flows, volcanic ash clouds and noticeable signs of giant
              activity from ages past, though today it is completely lifeless.
              Its ruler Surtr, the original fire giant, has not been seen or
              heard from in millennia.

            <p>
              Helheim, also known as Hel, is the primary Norse afterlife in the
              God of War series. It is the realm where people go when they die
              and is also where certain deities of the universe reside. Unlike
              Valhalla, which is reserved solely for those who have died
              'honorably' in combat, Helheim houses the vast majority of the
              rest of the universe's more neutral inhabitants.

            <hr />
            <p>
              Midgard is essentially a middle ground of sorts among the various
              realms, no pun intended; while not nearly as freezing as Helheim
              or Niflheim, it is still very cold. It is a vast, sprawling
              landscape of dense forests, snow-capped mountains laced with
              elaborate tunnel systems, intricate waterways and numerous ruins
              left over from various human and non-human civilisations.

              Upon first arriving in Alfheim you'd be forgiven for thinking that
              it was nicer than Midgard with it's lush forest terrain, tranquil
              waters and initially peaceful atmosphere. Then you witness a group
              of Dark Elves massacre a group of Light Elves and you realise that
              there's been a never-ending war raging here for longer than anyone
              can remember for no reason other than both sides want the other
              dead.

            <hr />
            <p>
              Asgard was the centrepiece of the Norse Gods' civilisation and the
              final home for only the greatest warriors who ever lived; a place
              where they could eat, drink, revel and fight for eternity, until
              Ragnarök came. On that day, it was prophesied that the giants will
              breach Asgard and give their lives annihilating the entire Norse
              pantheon.

            Kratos is a Spartan warrior who Ares tricked into killing his wife
            and son. This incident earned him the nickname the "Ghost of
            Sparta," as he was cursed with wearing his family's ashes on his
            body, making his skin pale as a ghost. While he wouldn't know it for
            most of his life, Kratos was a demigod as he is the son of Zeus, but
            he would later become a full-on god, the God of War to be precise,
            after killing Ares.

            Atreus is the son of Kratos in Faye. For most of his life, his
            father was absent, which led him to believe Kratos didn't care for
            him or his mother. During God of War Ragnarok, Atreus wants answers.
            He wants to know what being Loki means and his role in the upcoming
            battle. Kratos disapproves of this curiosity for the gods, seeing as
            how he has had his fair share of god-centric conflicts in the past.

            freed by Kratos and Atreus, he became their ally. Mímir, meaning
            "the rememberer" or "the wise one" in Old Norse, is a figure in
            Norse Mythology who is renowned for his knowledge and wisdom.

            Odin, also known as the All-Father, was the King of the Aesir and
            the ruler of the Norse Pantheon. He is the eldest son of Borr and
            Bestla, the brother of Vili, Vé and Hœnir, the father of Thor, Týr,
            Heimdall and Baldur, grandfather of Magni, Modi, Forseti and Thrúd,
            and ex-husband of Fjörgyn, Hróðr, Blóðughadda and Frigg.

            Týr is the Aesir God of War, Law, Justice, and Honor. Following a
            spiritual awakening, he gave up his role as the God of War, embarked
            on a journey of introspection, and changed his position to one of
            peace. Týr was imprisoned by Odin. After the death of Odin and the
            destruction of Asgard, he was freed by Kratos and Freya.
